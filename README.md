## Synopsis

**[GitCommitValidator](https://github.com/DWTechs/GitCommitValidator)** is an open source git commit message validator library.

## Motivation

The goal of this library is to provide an easy way to check if the current commit message is valid before pushing it to the remote.

It's a good way to help developers keep their commit messages clean on the repository and facilitate the workflow of a project with strict naming rules.

The default pattern follows the principles described [here](https://dwtechs.github.io/efficient-git/conventional-commit/).

You can also set your own rules using [custom patterns](#patterns).

You can validate branch names as well with [GitBranchValidator](https://github.com/DWTechs/GitBranchValidator)

## Installation

This library is written in Node.js.
You must install Node.js and npm in order to run it. 

### npm

```bash
$ npm i @dwtechs/gitcommitvalidator -g
```

### Yarn

```bash
$ yarn add @dwtechs/gitcommitvalidator -g
```

### Locally

Alternatively, if you are planning to use GitCommitValidator within your npm package only or with npx you can install it as a devDependency in your project.

```bash
$ npm i @dwtechs/gitcommitvalidator --save-dev
```

```bash
$ yarn add @dwtechs/gitcommitvalidator --dev
```

## Usage

**This library is meant to be used in the Git "commit-msg" hook.**
Thus it is not bound to Javascript application only and can be used by any git repository.

On server side hooks, it can be installed for "pre-receive" or "update" hook.

You can learn more about Git hooks and how ti cutomize them in the [Git Manual](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-An-Example-Git-Enforced-Policy)

Because hooks arenâ€™t transferred with a clone of a project, you must distribute these scripts some other way and then have your users copy them to their .git/hooks directory and make them executable. You can distribute these hooks within the project or in a separate project, but Git will not set them up automatically for you.

### Command line

```bash
$ gcvalidator --src <commit-message-file>
```

Alternatively if you did not install GitCommitValidator globally you can use npx.

```bash
$ npx gcvalidator --src <commit-message-file>
```


### get the commit message

The commit-msg hook takes one parameter, which is the path to a temporary file that contains the commit message written by the developer.
Therefore, you need to provide the path of this file:

```bash
$ gcvalidator --src $1
```
Where $1 should be equal to something like : .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG

Le library will then read the file in order to get the commit message.

### Patterns

#### Default patterns 

| name       | Pattern             |
| :--------- | :------------------ |
| commit     | **^(build\|ci\|doc\|feat\|fix\|perf\|refactor\|style\|test\|chore\|revert)\([a-z0-9]{2,16}\): \[[A-Za-z0-9\\#-]{2,12}\] [A-Za-z0-9 !-_]{5,140}$** |
| merge      | **^Merge branch '([a-zA-Z0-9\\#\-_:\/\\.\+]{5,65})' of ([a-zA-Z0-9\\#\-_:\/\\.\+]{10,90})$** |


The commit default pattern follows the principles described [here](https://dwtechs.github.io/efficient-git/conventional-commit/).
Which is a simplified version of conventional commits.

The merge default pattern is the default merge pattern used when Git is merging branches.

#### Custom patterns

You can use your own custom patterns by adding an optional regexp :

```bash
$ gcvalidator --src <commit-message-file> --patterns "^(feat|fix)\\([a-z0-9]{2,16}\\): \\[[A-Z0-9]{2,25}\\] [a-z0-9_\\. -]{3,60}$"
```

You can use several patterns if needed : 

```bash
$ cd <git-project>
$ gcvalidator --src <commit-message-file> --patterns "pattern1" "pattern2" "pattern3"
```

If one of them is valid, the commit message will be valid.


### Message

You can customize the end of the error message :

```bash
$ gcvalidator --src <commit-message-file> --message "You can learn more about commit message conventions of this project on https://dwtechs.github.io/efficient-git/conventional-commit/"
```

### Prompt

If the commit message is not valid, the process will be blocked by default.
You can use the option "--continue" to prompt the user instead.

```bash
$ gcvalidator --src <commit-message-file> --continue
```

In this case the user will be prompted about the invalid commit. He will be able to keep going if he choose so.

_Git hooks are not run in an interactive environment. So this option will fail if used in a Git hook._ 

### Help

You can access the documentation by passing the "help" parameter :

```bash
$ gcvalidator --help
```

### Workflow integration

Validate commit messages on commit-msg hook by adding the following code in the .git/hooks/commit-msg file : 

```bash
gcvalidator -src "$1"
```

You can use GitBranchValidator as well : 

```bash
gbvalidator && gcvalidator -src "$1"
```

You can find git hooks examples in the ./hooks/ folder.
To install them just paste them in the .git/hooks/ folder of your repositories.

| --continue   |  -c   | string  | Prompt the user if the commit message is not valid, instead of stopping the process. Does not work if used in Git kooks |
